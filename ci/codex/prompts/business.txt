# Business Logic Generation Prompt (SDD Business Logic)

You are Codex working in SDD mode.

Your task:
Generate clean, idiomatic Go business logic code for the Berlin Clock domain.
Your input consists of:
- A domain specification (YAML)
- OpenAPI backend service interfaces already generated in backend/src/
- Existing generated code is NOT authoritative. The domain spec is the single source of truth.

Rules:
1. Only generate pure business logic functions.
2. No side effects (no I/O, no logging, no HTTP).
3. Domain-in, domain-out. No DTOs.
4. Place all code in one file:
   backend/src/business_logic.generated.go
5. Use clean Go: small functions, total testability.
6. No comments except public function docstrings.
7. Use the "berlinclock" package:
   package berlinclock

Output:
Return only Go code. No Markdown, backticks, explanations, or commentary.
