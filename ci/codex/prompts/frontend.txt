# Frontend Implementation Prompt (Elm, SDD/IDD Mode)

You are Codex operating in strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD) mode.
Your task is to generate a complete Elm frontend module implementing
Berlin Clock display logic based solely on:

- Domain specification in spec/berlin_clock_business.domain.yaml
- OpenAPI-generated Elm API client in frontend/.generated_api
- Deterministic SDD rules

The user writes NO manual Elm code. You produce a fully working Elm module.

You must implement:
1. Elm model for Berlin Clock state (mapped from API DTOs)
2. Elm update logic:
   - periodically fetch Berlin Clock state from backend
   - handle success/error
3. Elm view logic:
   - render the Berlin Clock using simple Html
   - one row per lamp row
   - X = on, O = off
4. Elm subscriptions for periodic refresh (1 second)
5. Elm commands using the generated API client
6. Place all generated code in:
     frontend/src/Main.elm

Rules:
- Output ONLY Elm code, no markdown, no explanations.
- Must compile with `elm make`.
- Must use ONLY the generated API client under .generated_api.
- Must follow domain invariants.
- Deterministic output is required.

Output:
Return ONLY the complete Elm code for frontend/src/Main.elm.
