You are Codex.  
Generate clean, idiomatic Go code that implements the business logic for the Berlin Clock.  
Use the struct types generated from the OpenAPI specification located in backend/gen/api/go/.

The API layer is already generated.  
You only generate the BUSINESS LAYER.

Requirements:

1. You MUST implement business logic functions for:
   - Converting a normal time (HH:MM:SS) into Berlin Clock state.
   - Provide helper functions (pure functions, no side effects).
   - Use clean, testable Go.

2. You MUST implement these exported functions:

   func ComputeBerlinClockState(hours int, minutes int, seconds int) (BerlinClockState, error)

   A BerlinClockState has fields:
     SecondsLamp      string
     FiveHourRow      [4]string
     OneHourRow       [4]string
     FiveMinuteRow    [11]string
     OneMinuteRow     [4]string

3. Business rules:

   - Seconds lamp:
       ON  when seconds % 2 == 0
       OFF when seconds % 2 == 1

   - Five-hour row:
       Number of active lamps = hours / 5
       Active = "R", inactive = "O"

   - One-hour row:
       Number of active lamps = hours % 5
       Active = "R", inactive = "O"

   - Five-minute row:
       Number of active lamps = minutes / 5
       Lamps at positions 3, 6, 9 must be "R" (quarter markers)
       Otherwise active = "Y"
       Inactive = "O"

   - One-minute row:
       Number of active lamps = minutes % 5
       Active = "Y", inactive = "O"

4. Error handling:
   - Return error if hours < 0 or > 23
   - Return error if minutes < 0 or > 59
   - Return error if seconds < 0 or > 59

5. Output:
   ONLY code.
   No comments.
   No Markdown.
   No description.
   Just valid Go code.

6. File structure:
   Package name: berlinclock
   File name: berlin_clock_business.generated.go
